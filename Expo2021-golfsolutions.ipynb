    "# Code Golfing the BP D&A Python Coding Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "As I was testing our questions from the coding challenge, I started challenging myself by \"code golfing\" the solutions.  This refers to a game wherein you try to solve a problem with the least amount of code.  I decided to aim to write a solution to each problem in a single _logical_ line.  I wasn't trying to minimize characters, and in one case opted for a solution which was slightly longer by character count, as I found it more elegant.\n",
    "\n",
    "> By logical line, I mean a single Python statement.  That means that\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> x = (1 +\n",
    ">      2)\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> counts as a single logical line, while\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> x = 1; y = 2\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> counts as two.  I'm also not counting import lines because, hey, I get to make the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, you should **NEVER write code in this style** for any production process.  Python is a great language in part because of its focus on readability.  Many of these solutions throw away readability for terseness, and that is a poor trade off!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this process required me to make use of a number interesting Python features, and I thought Python students might like to learn some of them. These solutions do demonstrate a number of advanced techniques, like:\n",
    "- list, dictionary, and generator comprehensions\n",
    "- `map`\n",
    "- key functions for sorting\n",
    "- `lambda` functions\n",
    "- Pandas pipelining\n",
    "- Pandas query method\n",
    "- double comprehensions\n",
