    "The data are in the `data/Customer_telecom.csv` file.  Load this in as a pandas DataFrame.  Build a model that uses only the columns in the `features_to_use` list, below, to predict the value in the *churn* column.  Note that some features are numeric and some are categorical.  We recommend that you use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).\n",

It should have a `.predict` method that takes a DataFrame containing the 12 columns given in `features_to_use`, and returns an array of Booleans indicating whether the user is predicted to churn.  (Scikit-learn models will provide this automatically.)  This model will be evaluated on its accuracy on a held-out test set.\n",
